`UBT.nvim` is a plugin that allows you to run Unreal Engine's features like `compile_commands.json` generation, builds, project file generation, and static analysis directly from Neovim, asynchronously.

[**English**](./README.md) | [Japanese](./README_ja.md)

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Asynchronous Execution**: Runs the Unreal Build Tool in the background asynchronously using Neovim's native job control.
*   **Flexible Configuration System**: In addition to global settings, automatically loads project-specific configurations from a `.ubtrc` file in the project root.
*   **Rich UI Feedback**: (Optional) Integrates with [fidget.nvim](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim) to display real-time build progress.
*   **Interactive Error Browsing**: (Optional) Powerful integration with [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).
    *   Fuzzy find through build errors and warnings.
    *   Preview the code location of an error and jump to the file and line with a single keypress.
    *   Select build targets or `compile_commands.json` generation targets directly from a Telescope picker.

## üîß Requirements

*   Neovim v0.11.3 or higher
*   [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) (**Optional**)
*   [fidget.nvim](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim) (**Optional**)
*   An environment where Unreal Build Tool is usable (`dotnet` command, etc.).
*   Visual Studio 2022 with the Clang compiler component installed via the Visual Studio Installer.
*   Currently only supports the Windows environment. Support for other OSes is planned once I have access to the necessary environments.

## üöÄ Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
-- plugins/ubt.lua

return {
  'taku25/UBT.nvim',
  dependencies = {
      "j-hui/fidget.nvim", -- (Optional)
  },
  opts = {},
}
```

> **Note**: To enable the Telescope extension, it is recommended to add `UBT.nvim` as a dependency in your Telescope configuration and load the extension.

```lua
-- plugins/telescope.lua
return {
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  dependencies = { "taku25/UBT.nvim" },
  config = function()
    local telescope = require("telescope")
    telescope.setup({ /* ... */ })
    telescope.load_extension("ubt")
  end,
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can customize the plugin's behavior by passing a table to the `setup()` function. If you are using `lazy.nvim`, pass this table to the `opts` key.
The following shows all available options and their default values.

```lua
-- in your init.lua or config block for the plugin

opts = {
  -- Pre-defined build targets.
  presets = {
    -- The available built-in presets are:
    --  Win64Debug, Win64DebugGame, Win64Develop, Win64Test, Win64Shipping, 
    --  Win64DebugWithEditor, Win64DebugGameWithEditor, Win64DevelopWithEditor
    -- To add new presets or override existing ones, write as follows:
    -- Override an existing preset
    { name = "Win64DevelopWithEditor", Platform = "Win64", IsEditor = true, Configuration = "Development" },
    -- Add a new preset
    { name = "StreamOSShipping", Platform = "Stream", IsEditor = false, Configuration = "Shipping" },
  },

  -- The default target name used when the argument is omitted for :UBT Build or :UBT GenCompileDB.
  preset_target = "Win64DevelopWithEditor",

  -- The default linter type for :UBT Lint.
  -- Available options: Default, VisualCpp, PVSStudio, Clang
  -- For the differences between each type, please check the UnrealBuildTool documentation.
  lint_type = "Default",
  
  -- UBT.nvim's basic operation is to read the .uproject file and use EngineAssociation
  -- to automatically find the Unreal Build Tool. Use this option if you want to
  -- explicitly specify the engine path.
  -- Example: "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.4"
  engine_path = nil,

  -- === Logging and Notification Settings ===

  -- Determines which message level is displayed as a notification (uses `vim.notify`).
  -- Available options: "NONE", "ERROR", "WARN", "ALL"
  notify_level = "NONE",

  -- Determines which output level from the running Unreal Build Tool is displayed (uses `fidget.nvim`).
  -- Available options: "NONE", "ERROR", "WARN", "ALL"
  progress_level = "ALL",

  -- Determines which message level is displayed in the message area (uses `vim.echo`).
  -- Available options: "NONE", "ERROR", "WARN", "ALL"
  message_level = "ERROR",

  -- Log file names (created within Neovim's cache directory).
  -- Format: <neovim cache dir>/UBT/<logfile_name>
  log_file_name = "diagnostics.log",   -- Persistent log for all UBT.nvim activity
  progress_file_name = "progress.log", -- Temporary log for the latest UBT run

  -- Whether to customize the fidget.nvim display.
  -- This plugin internally customizes the LSP type "UBT".
  -- If you want to use your own settings, set this to false and configure
  -- the style for LSP type "UBT" in your fidget.nvim opts.
  enable_override_fidget = true,

  -- The shell used to run `vim.job`. Currently, only "cmd" is supported.
  -- Even if you start Neovim from PowerShell, lunch.bat will be started with the specified shell.
  shell = "cmd",
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project-Specific Settings (.ubtrc) 
You can define settings that are only active for a specific project by creating a JSON file named `.ubtrc` in the project's root directory (the current directory of Neovim when you run a UBT command).
`.ubtrc` settings take precedence over global `setup()` settings.

Example `.ubtrc`:
```json
{
  "preset_target": "StreamOS",
  "engine_path": "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.6",
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "StreamOSTest",
      "Platform": "Win64",
      "IsEditor": true,
      "Configuration": "Test"
    },
    {
      "name": "StreamOSShipping",
      "Platform": "Stream",
      "IsEditor": false,
      "Configuration": "Shipping"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö° Usage

**Please `cd` into the directory containing your `.uproject` file before executing commands.**

```viml
:UBT GenCompileDB [target_name]     " Generates compile_commands.json.
:UBT Build [target_name]            " Builds the project with the specified (or default) target.
:UBT GenProject                     " Generates project files for Visual Studio, etc.
:UBT Lint [linter_type] [target_name] " Runs static analysis.
``` 

### üî≠ Telescope Integration 

```viml
:Telescope ubt diagnostics          " Lists information from the last job run.
:Telescope ubt build                " Lists configured build targets and starts a build on selection.
:Telescope ubt gencompiledb         " Select a build target to start generating compile_commands.json.
```
